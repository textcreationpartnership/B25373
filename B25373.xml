            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Kings Excellent Majesty having received information of the proceedings of the Earle of VVARWICK at Sea, and that hee had order and command from both His Houses of PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAMENT, to make stay of all those Ships that were resolved to transport any Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition towards the North, for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of His Majesty, which Order and command did not a little move his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, whereby divers thoughts arose from His Royall and Princely Majesties minde,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:197435:3"/> but after some time of consultation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, His Majesty resolved to send this joyfull Message to the Right Honourable <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> whereby hee might fully understand his Majesties will and pleasure, which Message did intimate and import the Desires and Propositions of His Majesty, and how earnest and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous he was to preserve the Peace and prosperity of his Parliament; And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise declares to the said Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> his desire, that unity and peace might flourish in his Three Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>And His Majesty likewise tendered to the said Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions following:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That he would be pleased to resigne the Navy into his owne proper custody.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That he would be pleased to deliver vp the said Navy with all the things thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, and that if he would condiscend unto these his Maiesties desires, hee would account him a true and loyall Subiect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And his Maiesty taking into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:197435:3"/> the directions which both his houses of Parliament, had sent the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> to goe to the River <hi>Humber,</hi> with as many ships as he should thinke sit for that service, for the assistance and reliese of Sr. <hi>John Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> his Maiestie was very much displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therewith, by reason that he expected the giving up of the Towne to him.</p>
            <p>His Maiestie declares, that it was an ill prologue to a message that might compose the destruction of his Kingdome, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his Majesty hath oftentimes declared, that the levying of warre was for no other end but for his owne safeguard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Hee doth further declare with a particular passage, that although the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of His Majesties person and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath proceeded in some particulars, yet he professeth, that all men may know and perceive, hath been done in this way, and he takes God to witnesse, that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to both Houses of Parliament hath bin reall, not having the least thought of taking or levying any warre against
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:197435:4"/> His Parliament. This is the Message which His Majesty sent to the Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> wherein hee declares his Reall intentions therein.</p>
            <p>And wherein is laid open the will and pleasure of his Majesty, and the Desires and Propositions that he rendreth to the said Earle of <hi>Warwicke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now followes and proceeds the Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Answer to the aforesaid Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</p>
            <p>The Right Honourable Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke</hi> professeth to His Mtjesty, that for the resigning up of the Navie to his Majesty, hee cannot doe it without the consent of that power which had reposed that trust in him; neither would hee betray the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust that was reposed in him by the high and Honourable Court of Parliament, but were resolved to enjoy that place till hee were put from it by that power which had intrusted him with it.</p>
            <p>Also the said Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that if the Honourable Houses of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:197435:4"/> Parliament will give him leave and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, hee will use his skill and endeavour for the redeeming of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> it being now taken by Colonell <hi>Goring,</hi> who hath placed a strong Garison therein, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to keepe and defend the same towne and Castle of Portsmouth to the uttermost of his power.</p>
            <p>The Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, doe humbly desire His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie to condescend unto these Requests.</p>
            <p>Upon Wednesday last there was a report made to the House of Commons touching Colonell <hi>Goring</hi> of his determination to possesse <hi>Portsmouth</hi> on the Kings behalfe, and his discharging of those Soldiers would not stand close to him therein, and that he had gotten a great summe of money from the County to pay his men, which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a Conference betweene both Houses for the sittingest course to be taken therin, and they concluded of a joynt Order to issue to command his repaire to the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:197435:5"/> to answer the same; as likewise to command his delivery up of the said Town to such as they appointed, which said Order presently issued, and a Messenger dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched therewith.</p>
